# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction & Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) is a crucial metric in business analytics that estimates the total revenue a customer is expected to generate over their relationship with a company. This project aims to predict CLV using real-world transaction data, leveraging **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning models, and Business Intelligence dashboards**.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle Retail Datasets]
- **Features:**
  - `CustomerID` - Unique identifier for customers
  - `InvoiceNo` - Transaction invoice number
  - `InvoiceDate` - Date of transaction
  - `Quantity` - Number of units purchased
  - `UnitPrice` - Price per unit of product
  - `TotalPrice` - `Quantity * UnitPrice`
  - `Country` - Customer's location

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- **SQL** (Data extraction and transformation)
- **Power BI / Tableau** (Visualization & Dashboarding)
- **Streamlit** (Web App Deployment)

## 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values and duplicates.
   - Convert date columns to proper format.
   - Create `TotalRevenue` and `Customer Age` features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Analyze revenue distribution per customer.
   - Identify top-performing customers.
   - Visualize customer behavior trends.

3. **RFM Segmentation:**
   - Calculate **Recency (R), Frequency (F), and Monetary (M) scores**.
   - Segment customers into high-value vs low-value groups.

4. **CLV Prediction using Machine Learning:**
   - Train Regression models to predict CLV.
   - Compare performance using **RMSE, R² Score**.

5. **Dashboard & Insights:**
   - Build interactive dashboards showing CLV trends.
   - Provide **actionable business insights** to optimize marketing strategies.

## 📈 Results & Findings
- Customers with higher frequency and monetary value tend to have higher CLV.
- Top 20% of customers generate **80% of total revenue** (Pareto principle).
- Machine Learning models achieve **X% accuracy (RMSE = XYZ)** in CLV prediction.
- Business recommendations for **customer retention & personalized marketing**.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
